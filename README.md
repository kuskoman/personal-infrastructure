# personal-infrstructure

Infrastructure repo for personal projects. You probably don't want to use that
but feel free to look how do I solve problems that I encounter with personal-projects
infrastructure provisioning (and suggest a better solutions!).

## Prerequisites

The repo uses few providers:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](digitalocean.com)

### Cloudflare

CloudFlare requires:

- a registered domain assigned to CloudFlare
- a working [API Token](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/create-token/)

### DigitalOcean

DigitalOcean requires:

- an empty (or not :D) space
- [API Key](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-digitalocean-space-and-api-key)

I am using free funds from [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) here.
